Cubeia Poker is based on Cubeia Firebase and Cubeia Network. Both products are
open source and in production.

single server setup up to a services oriented distributed cluster system. It is
mainly implemented in java.


BUILD & START

The folder "system" contains a quick-start and some more advanced options.


DEVELOPMENT
===========

Information subjecting development is contained within the module folders. Some
general info can be found in the folder doc.

are however some limitations of maven, which can result in an unusual structure.

context of commercial customer services.
