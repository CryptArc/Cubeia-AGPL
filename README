IMPORTANT
=========

Cubeia Poker is based on Cubeia Firebase and Cubeia Network. Both products are
open sourced and in production.

PREREQUISITES
=============

* Java SDK 1.6 or higher
* Maven 3.0.4 or higher

BUILD & START
=============

* Change into "cubeia-poker" directory (or any other directory you've chosen)

* First follow the README within ./server, in order to run the poker-server.

* Next follow the README within ./client/web. This will allow you to
play poker with a web-browser. If you want to try or develop other clients,
review the ./client/README.

* Follow the README within ./server/bot-modules/bot, in order to test
your current setup with some poker-bots.

* Finally, see the README within ./backoffice/poker-admin to setup the
web-application that manages the poker-game (timings, tables, tournaments).

* To get a complete poker-system (with user management, accounting, wallet), you
have to install the Cubeia Network, see ./backoffice/README.TXT. Note
that this can become a difficult step, due to the ongoing development.

FULL BUILD
==========

To build all relevant sources in one pass, use
