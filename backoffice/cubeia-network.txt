Cubeia Network, which contains major backoffice functionality, is currently not
included here.

You can run it easily from the "bundle", which contains a tomcat server and all
the necessary setup, including a bundled file-based database:

http://m2.cubeia.com/nexus/content/repositories/foss-releases/com/cubeia/network/cubeia-network-bundle

Extract the actual bundle, and follow the instructions.

RUNNING FROM SOURCE

You can of course run Cubeia Network directly from the sources:

hg clone https://mercurial.cubeia.com/network/

You need to start each service (user-service, wallet-service, operator-service,
backoffice) on its own, via:

cd NETWORK_HOME/<service>/service-rest
mvn package jetty:run
