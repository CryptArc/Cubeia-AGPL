=================================================================================
               CUBEIA POKER SOURCE-CODE BASED INSTALLATION
================================================================================


PREREQUISITES
=============

* Java SDK 1.7
* Maven 3.0.4 or higher


IMPORTANT
=========

Please follow this sequence *strictly*, otherwise you will run into a cascade of
problems. If you ask for support on the forum, please mention which steps
succeeded so far, and with which step you got the problem.

You will need half an hour for the first steps, but some hours (or days) to
complete until the integration of Cubeia Network.

Finally: don't forget that Cubeia Poker is under development. This alone makes
things sometimes very difficult, especially when updating to newer versions.


BASICS
======

* Ensure that maven has enough memory reserved, otherwise you will possibly run
into annoying "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space". On linux just do:

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m";

* Avoid using an IDE if you are not familiar with one, as this can introduce
additional barriers. Use the command-line and simple editors. Later, when you
feel safer with the sources, you can go on to use an IDE (eclipse, netbeans,
IntelliJ, etc.).



QUICK-START
================================================================================

mvn clean package -Pclient,bots,admin,network,no-integrations
cd  uar
mvn firebase:run

CLIENT: you should be able to access the game at:

http://localhost:8181

There is no user registration at this point. Use any name, and the password
should be an integer > 1000 (e.g.: test/1001).

BOTS: in order to get some opponents, go to the bots at:

http://localhost:8081

The default values will create 100 bots, just press OK button. You should see
now within the lobby that tables are getting players. Join one or more tables
and check the game.

After this, you can start tournament bots, and join a tournament.

ADMIN

http://localhost:8088

You can see the functionality, but most of it is not usable. To
make the Poker Admin functional, go on with the next steps, which will allow you
to manages the poker-game (timings, tables, tournaments etc.).


DATABASES
================================================================================

MYSQL DB
========

Mandatory: create a mysql database.
the default configuration is: db: poker, user: poker, pass: poker
to change: ./backoffice/poker-admin/src/test/resources/jetty-env.xml

A simple way is to use the "initdb.sql" script file. Just copy&paste it to the
mysql command-lin, or execute it, giving the full path, e.g. 

mysql> source ./backoffice/poker-admin/initdb.sql


MONGO DB
========

Optionally: for hand histories and tournament histories, create a mongodb
the default configuration is: db: poker, user: poker, pass: poker
to change: ./backoffice/poker-admin/src/test/resources/admin.properties


CONFIG
======

within file:

./uar/src/test/resources/firebase/conf/cluster.props

change "use-mock-integrations=true"
to     "use-mock-integrations=false"

This will disable the use of the predefined test (mock) tables and tournaments,
thus you can use your own.

Stop and start the poker game with firebase:run, then go on with the next step.


ADMIN DATA
==========

Create a Table Templates, which should result in tables showing up in the lobby.
The names for the tables are picked up from a list.

Now you can create a simple Sit&Go, which should show up in the lobby.

Last, create a Scheduled Tournament template.



USER, ACCOUNT AND OPERATOR MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Within the Poker Admin, create the basic data.

OPERATOR
========

Create an Operator with the ID 1

CURRENCY & ACCOUNTS
===================

From within the mysql cmd-line, execute:

mysql> use wallet_service; source ./backoffice/poker-admin/wallet.sql;

This will create EUR currency and 3 accounts.

Important: if you create more currencies later, you have to create those 3
accounts for the currencies, too.

The type is SYSTEM_ACCOUNT and enable to option "negative balance allowed".

 * SYSTEM_ACCOUNT | EUR | OPEN | UserID -1000 | Rake
 * SYSTEM_ACCOUNT | EUR | OPEN | UserID -2000 | Promotions
 * SYSTEM_ACCOUNT | EUR | OPEN | UserID -3000 | General 


CREATE USERS & BOTS
===================

Create some users. Username, password and Operator ID (1) is enough data.

Alternatively, you can use the user-creator tool, which will
add an account with some cash for the created user.

./tools/user-creator/README.TXT


BOTS
====

Bots are like other users, so if you want to use the bots, you have to create
accounts for them, too.


INTEGRATION BUILD
=================

Î¤he default build of the poker-server results in a system with mock-services
(or mock-integrations). This means that there is no reall user and account
management.

In order to build & start a poker system which integrates fully:

* build the poker code with "use-integrations" (instead of "no-integrations").

mvn clean package -Pclient,bots,admin,network,use-integrations
cd  uar
mvn firebase:run

You now login with the user credentials created earlier.


FULL REBUILD
============

After source code updates, to build all relevant sources in one pass, go to the
root directory (e.g. cubeia-poker) and execute

mvn clean package install -U -Pclient,bots,admin,network,use-integrations

The "-U" flag ensures that dependencies are updated (important when sources are
under development).



ADVANCED STEPS
================================================================================

FIREBASE
========

Firebase was fetched during the build. You can start the poker-server directly
by starting firebase from within

./uar/target/firebase-run/firebase-<version>-CE

This location (the "target" folder) is overwritten by a clean build (mvn clean).

Once your poker-system runs fine, you can copy the firebase folder to another
location. If your poker directory resides in e.g. mycubeia/poker, you could copy
firebase to mycubeia/firebase.

In this case, you either have to copy new versions of the poker-uar.uar into the
firebase/game/deploy directory, or you have to make a symbolic link. Remember to
verify the configuration files (new files or new configuration data).


USER REGISTRATION
================= 

At this point, there is not user registration available. This is be-
cause Cubeia has decided to not provide any public-facing websites / code (e.g.
where users can register themselves).

Edit the OPERATOR 1 to setup links to the website (e.g. wordpress site) you 
want to integrate).


PRODUCTION SETUP
================================================================================

A production setup is a complex task, which is out of the scope of this document.

A few hints give you an example direction you can go.

FIREBASE
========

Use the folder generate by firebas:run as a foundation (as stated previously).

Ommit the modules (client, bots, admin, network) that you will deploy to tomcat,
or that you will start manually (e.g. the bots manager).

mvn clean package -Puse-integrations

CONFIG
======

As Cubeia Network will be started outside the development environment, 
configuration starts.

within ./backoffice/poker-admin/src/test/resources/admin.properties, change the
ports of user/wallet/operator services to 8080.

within ./uar/src/test/resources/firebase/conf/cluster.props
   - set use-mock-integrations=false"
   - change the ports of user, wallet and operator services to 8080
     (http://localhost:8080)


CUBEIA NETWORK
==============

Retrieve the code and follow the contained instructions to setup:

https://bitbucket.org/cubeia/cubeia-network

Once you have access to the Cubeia Network Webapplication, you have to create
some basic data, thus the Poker Admin and the Poker Game works.

* DEPLOY TO TOMCAT

The Cubeia Network bundle contains a tomcat. You can use it to deploy your wars
there, namely the "poker-client.war" and the "poker-admin.war".

The process for war deployment is usually:

* copy (or symlink) the war to tomcat/webapps
* copy (or symlink) the relevant config files to tomcat/lib
* copy (or symlink) database deploy-files to relevant location

Start with the simpler poker-client. On success, you'll have it at:

http://localhost:8080/poker-client

Then go on with the poker-admin. On success, you'll have it at:

http://localhost:8080/poker-admin

If things fail, just fall-back to your command-line started versions.
