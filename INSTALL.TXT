CUBEIA POKER SOURCE-CODE BASED INSTALLATION
===========================================


PREREQUISITES
=============

* Java SDK 1.7 (1.6 works, too)
* Maven 3.0.4 or higher


IMPORTANT
=========

Please follow this sequence strictly, otherwise you will run into a cascade of
problems. If you ask for support on the forum, please mention which steps
succeeded so far, and with which step you got the problem.

You will need half an hour for the first steps, but  some hours (or days) to
complete until the integration of Cubeia Network. Do yourself a favor and take
the 10 min. to read through all the README's first. You won't regret.


STEPS
=====

* SERVER
Follow the README within ./server, in order to run the poker-server.

* CLIENT
Next follow the README within ./client/web. This will allow you to
play poker with a web-browser. If you want to try or develop other clients,
review the ./client/README.

There is no user registration at this point. Use any name, and the password
should be an integer (best: > 1000), it will be used as the playerId.

* BOTS
Follow the README within ./server/bot-modules/bot, in order to test
your current setup with some poker-bots.

* ADMIN
Finally, see the README within ./backoffice/poker-admin to setup the 
web-application that manages the poker-game (timings, tables, tournaments).



FULL REBUILD
============

After source code updates, to build all relevant sources in one pass, go to the
root directory (e.g. cubeia-poker) and execute

mvn clean package install -U

If you have integrated Cubeia Network, execute

mvn clean package install -U -P use-integrations

The "-U" flag ensures that dependencies are updated (important when sources are
under development).
