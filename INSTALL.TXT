================================================================================
               CUBEIA POKER SOURCE-CODE BASED INSTALLATION
================================================================================


PREREQUISITES
=============

* Java SDK 1.7
* Maven 3.0.4 or higher
* Mercurial 


IMPORTANT
=========

Please follow this sequence *strictly*, otherwise you will run into a cascade of
problems. If you ask for support on the forum, please mention which steps
succeeded so far, and with which step you got the problem.

You will need half an hour for the first steps, but some hours (or days) to
complete until the integration of Cubeia Network.

Finally: don't forget that Cubeia Poker is under development. This alone makes
things sometimes very difficult, especially when updating to newer versions.


BASICS
======

* Ensure that maven has enough memory reserved, otherwise you will possibly run
into annoying "java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space". On linux just do:

export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m";

* Avoid using an IDE if you are not familiar with one, as this can introduce
additional barriers. Use the command-line and simple editors. Later, when you
feel safer with the sources, you can go on to use an IDE (eclipse, netbeans,
IntelliJ, etc.).


QUICK-START
================================================================================

hg clone https://bitbucket.org/cubeia/cubeia-poker
cd cubeia-poker
mvn clean install
cd  system/simple
mvn firebase:run

http://localhost:8181 - CLIENT

There is no user registration at this point. Use any name, and the password
should be an integer > 1000 (e.g.: test/1001).

Join a table. Use a 2nd browser to sit with a 2nd player to make a quick test.


http://localhost:8081 - BOTS (to get some more opponents)

The default values will create 10 bots, just press OK button. You should see
within the lobby that tables are getting players. Join one or more tables
and check the game.

After this, you can start tournament bots, asking them to leave one seat open,
so you can join a tournament.


http://localhost:8088 - ADMIN

Get a look at the Admin application. It will become functional with the next
steps.


INTEGRATED (USER, ACCOUNT AND OPERATOR MANAGEMENT)
================================================================================

The default build of the poker-system results in a system with mock-services
(or mock-integrations). This means that there is no real user and account
management.

In order to build & start a poker system which integrates fully:

MONGO DB
========

Mandatory: for hand histories and tournament histories, install mongodb on your
system.

http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

Ensure to have mongod running. The database will be created by the software, 
default configuration is: db: poker, user: poker, pass: poker

INTEGRATION BUILD
=================

It's not  necessary to rebuild the whole source, just the system/simple will be
repackaged with integrations:

cd  system/simple
mvn clean package -Puse-integrations
mvn firebase:run -Dhibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create

the -Dhibernate.hbm2ddl.auto=create creates the database schema and adds most
of the initial data. Please take care when restarting, as this will overwrite
any existing data.

Within the Poker Admin (http://localhost:8088) create an Operator 1 (e.g. 'Main')

CREATE USERS & BOTS
===================

Create some users. Username, password and Operator ID (1) is enough data.

You can use the user-creator tool, which will add an account with some cash for 
the created user. The following will create 10 users:

  cd tools/user-creator/target
  java -jar user-creator.jar -d -u Test -p 1 -o 1 -r 10 

You can now login with the user credentials created.

BOTS: are like other users, so if you want to use the bots in an integrated 
system, you have to create accounts for them, too.

  java -jar user-creator.jar -d -u Bot -p 1 -o 0 -r 120

For more info on the user-creator tool, see the README.TXT.


OPERATE THE GAME
================

http://localhost:8181 - CLIENT

http://localhost:8081 - BOTS (to get some more opponents)

http://localhost:8088 - ADMIN

Create a Table Template, which should result in tables showing up in the lobby.
The names for the tables are picked up from a list. 

Now you can create a simple Sit&Go, which should show up in the lobby.

Last, create a Scheduled Tournament template.


FULL REBUILD
============

After source code updates via

hg pull -u

in the root directory, build all relevant sources in one pass with

mvn clean package install -U -Puse-integrations

The "-U" flag ensures that dependencies are updated (important when sources are
under development).



ADVANCED STEPS
================================================================================

FIREBASE
========

Firebase was fetched during the build. You can start the poker-server directly
by starting firebase from within

./system/simple/target/firebase-run/firebase-<version>-CE

This location (the "target" folder) is overwritten by a clean build (mvn clean),
or when calling firebase:run.

Once your poker-system runs fine, you can copy the firebase folder to another
location. If your poker directory resides in e.g. mycubeia/poker, you could copy
firebase to mycubeia/firebase.

In this case, you either have to copy new versions of the poker-uar.uar into the
firebase/game/deploy directory, or you have to make a symbolic link. Remember to
verify the configuration files (new files or new configuration data).


DATABASES
================================================================================

The simple system uses an embedded H2 database, enabling this way a simplified
setup. You may want to change to a mysql database.

MYSQL DB
========

Mandatory: create a mysql database.
the default configuration is: db: poker, user: poker, pass: poker

A simple way is to use the "initdb.sql" script file. Just copy&paste it to the
mysql command-line, or execute it, giving the full path, e.g. 

mysql> source ./backoffice/poker-admin/src/sql/initdb.sql;

This will create 4 mysql databases (poker, accounting, user, operator).

You have to change the deployed datasources within:

./src/test/resources/firebase/conf/game/deploy



USER REGISTRATION
================= 

At this point, there is not user registration available. This is because Cubeia 
has decided to not provide any public-facing websites / code (e.g.
where users can register themselves).

The typical use-case is to integrate Cubeia Poker with an existing website.

Edit the OPERATOR 1 to setup links to the website (e.g. wordpress site) you 
want to integrate).

There are several supporting modules available, like e.g. a simple jdbc login
to an existent database (of your website, e.g. wordpress based):

www.cubeia.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorials/howto_jdbc_login

An alternative way would be, to implement a module which works against the 
cubeia network user API, using this way the included user database.
