IMPORTANT:

The web (HTML5) client is the main client to use.

The java-textclient (cmd-line) is a simple test tool.

As a foundation for own development work, you can find unmaintained and 
out-of-synch clients (flex, javascript) within ./attic. Note that those are
totally unsupported.


TODO: 

* java-textclient is essentiall a tool, could be moved to the tools folder 
  within the server

* "web" would then become "./client", as its the main client of the system
