=================================================================================
               CUBEIA POKER SOURCE-CODE BASED INSTALLATION
================================================================================


PREREQUISITES
=============

See INSTALL.TXT for some basics.

PRODUCTION SETUP
================================================================================

A production setup is a complex task, which is not completely described in this
document. More instructions will be given once Cubeia Poker gets released.

A few hints give you an example direction you can go.

FIREBASE
========

You can use the folder generate by firebas:run (see INSTALL.TXT) as a foundation.

Ommit the modules (client, bots, admin, network) that you will deploy to tomcat,
or that you will start manually (e.g. the bots manager).

mvn clean package -Puse-integrations

CONFIG
======

As Cubeia Network will be started outside the development environment, 
configuration starts.

within ./backoffice/poker-admin/src/test/resources/admin.properties, change the
ports of user/wallet/operator services to 8080.

within ./uar/src/test/resources/firebase/conf/cluster.props
   - set use-mock-integrations=false"
   - change the ports of user, wallet and operator services to 8080
     (http://localhost:8080)


CUBEIA NETWORK
==============

Retrieve the code and follow the contained instructions to setup:

https://bitbucket.org/cubeia/cubeia-network

Once you have access to the Cubeia Network Webapplication, you have to create
some basic data, thus the Poker Admin and the Poker Game works.

* DEPLOY TO TOMCAT

The Cubeia Network bundle contains a tomcat. You can use it to deploy your wars
there, namely the "poker-client.war" and the "poker-admin.war".

The process for war deployment is usually:

* copy (or symlink) the war to tomcat/webapps
* copy (or symlink) the relevant config files to tomcat/lib
* copy (or symlink) database deploy-files to relevant location

Start with the simpler poker-client. On success, you'll have it at:

http://localhost:8080/poker-client

Then go on with the poker-admin. On success, you'll have it at:

http://localhost:8080/poker-admin

If things fail, just fall-back to your command-line started versions.
